# 🌿 Botanical Leathers: The Art of Vegetable Tanning

**From petal to pelt. Thrive without the hunt.**

Playing a pacifist character? Tired of hunting wolves just to make a backpack, or managing massive cattle farms? **Botanical Leathers** offers an immersive, ethical, and complete alternative to obtain leather solely from the flora of Vintage Story.

This mod doesn't just "give" you leather; it introduces rewarding crafting processes that fit perfectly into the game's existing balance.

### ✨ Main Features

This mod introduces three distinct methods to craft **Vegetable Hides**, tailored to your biome and resources:

🍄 **I. The Fungal Path (Fast & Damp)**
Don't let your common mushrooms rot away. This is the most direct method: soak your fungi, press them to extract the water, and beat the remaining fibers.
*   *Ideal for:* Temperate zones and humid forests.

🍎 **II. The Fruit Path (Recycling & Cooking)**
A great way to value your waste! Recover the **mash** from your Apples and Mangoes after pressing them for juice. Transform this pulp into a hot **Botanical Paste**, bound with wax or resin.
*   *The Challenge:* The paste hardens as it cools, requiring careful time and temperature management.

🌵 **III. The Fiber Path (Resilience & Climate)**
Survive in deserts and tropics using structural fibers. Harvest **Pineapple Leaves** or **Cactus Fibers** to create a tough hide capable of rivaling animal leather.

🌳 IV. The Cork Path (Engineering & Assembly)
The pinnacle of botanical crafting. Collect the bark when stripping your Oak logs to extract a unique, resilient material.

The Process: A realistic production chain. Bark must be soaked, dried, then bundled and steamed in a fire to gain elasticity.
The Assembly: Unlike pastes, cork is worked in sheets. Use Resin to glue sheets together, and Linen to reinforce the huge hides (Vegetable Composite).

### ⚙️ Seamless Integration

*   **100% Vanilla Compatible:** All methods result in the creation of a standard **Soaked Hide**. Once obtained, you finish the work exactly as usual (Scraping, Oak/Acacia tanning, etc.).
*   **Zero Waste:** Extracting fibers via the Fruit Press generates a nutrient-rich liquid residue, perfect for boosting your **Compost**.
*   **Balanced:** Vegetable leather requires work, tools (Fruit Press, Cooking Pot, Hammer), and time. It is not an "easy mode," but a different, rewarding path.

**Rediscover crafting. Leave the beasts in peace.**
