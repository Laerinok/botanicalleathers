Driven by a desire for peace, I turned to the flora. Hidden within cactus fibers and fungal flesh lies a strength equal to any pelt. This almanac guides you through these cruelty-free alternatives.\n\n<strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"handbook://botanicalleathers-fungalpath\">I.

  "game:botanicalleathers-fungalpath-text": "<strong>I. THE FUNGAL PATH</strong>\n<i>Fast and porous.</i>\n\nThe damp corners of the world offer the quickest route to leather. Fungi, when treated correctly, possess a surprising elasticity similar to skin.\n\n<strong>1. Saturation (Barrel)</strong>\nOrdinary mushrooms are brittle. To toughen them, they must be submerged in a <strong>Barrel of Water</strong>. Let them drink until they become bloated <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:soakedmushroom-slop\">Soaked Mushrooms</a></strong>.\n\n<strong>2. Extraction (Press)</strong>\nThese sodden lumps must be purged. Place them in a <strong>Fruit Press</strong> to separate the solid matter.\n<i>Note: The dark <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:residue-fungal\">Fungal Residue</a></strong> that flows out is rich in nutrients and serves as an excellent starter for Compost.</i>\n\n<strong>3. Binding (Grid)</strong>\nRecover the <strong>Pressed Mash</strong>. On a crafting table, use a <strong>Hammer</strong> to beat the fibers together. They will fuse into a <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalhide-prepared-small-fungus\">Fungal Prepared Hide</a></strong>.",

  "game:botanicalleathers-fruitpath-text": "<strong>II. THE FRUIT PATH</strong>\n<i>From Sweetness to Strength.</i>\n\nAbundance often brings waste, but the resourceful naturalist sees opportunity. The leftover pomace of <strong>Apples</strong> and <strong>Mangoes</strong> can be transformed into a leather-like material through heat and binding.\n\n<strong>1. Preparation (Press & Knife)</strong>\nWe seek the dry fiber, not the juice. First, process fruits in a <strong>Fruit Press</strong>. Take the resulting mash and refine it with a <strong>Knife</strong> to create <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:slicedbotanicalpulp-apple\">Sliced Fruit Pulp</a></strong>.\n\n<strong>2. The Alchemical Bond (Pot)</strong>\nPulp alone crumbles. It needs a binder to become skin. Boil the sliced pulp in a <strong>Cooking Pot</strong> along with <strong>Resin</strong> or <strong>Beeswax</strong> to create the <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalpitch-apple-hot\">botanical paste</a></strong>.\n\n<strong>3. Shaping (Bowl & Grid)</strong>\n<i>Warning: Time is of the essence.</i>\nThe mixture is too viscous to pour. Use an <strong>Empty Bowl</strong> to scoop the <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalpitch-apple-hot\">Hot Botanical Paste</a></strong> directly from the pot. Place this filled bowl into the crafting grid and strike it with a <strong>Hammer</strong> to forge the <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalhide-prepared-small-fruit\">Fruit Prepared Hide</a></strong>.\n<i>(If the paste hardens, simply reheat it).</i>",

  "game:botanicalleathers-fiberpath-text": "<strong>III. THE FIBER PATH</strong>\n<i>The Spine and the Leaf.</i>\n\nWhere fruit offers softness, the desert and the tropics offer resilience. The tough fibers of <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalfiber-pineappleleaf-raw\">Pineapple Leaves</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalfiber-cactusfiber-raw\">Cactus</a></strong> yield the most durable botanical hides, structured to withstand the elements.\n\n<strong>1. Fracture (Press & Knife)</strong>\nThe structural integrity of these plants must be broken. First, crush the harvested fibers in a <strong>Fruit Press</strong>. Take the resulting mash and slice it finely with a <strong>Knife</strong> to prepare it for binding.\n<i>Bonus: The liquid residue extracted is a potent compost starter.</i>\n\n<strong>2. Fusion (Pot)</strong>\nLike the fruit method, these fibers require a binder. Boil the sliced pulp in a <strong>Cooking Pot</strong> with <strong>Resin</strong> or <strong>Beeswax</strong> until it forms a thick, <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalpitch-apple-hot\">hot paste</a></strong>.\n\n<strong>3. Shaping (Bowl & Grid)</strong>\nWhile the mixture is bubbling, use an <strong>Empty Bowl</strong> to scoop up the <strong>Hot Botanical Paste</strong>. Immediately place the filled bowl onto the crafting grid and strike it with a <strong>Hammer</strong>. The impact aligns the fibers into a <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalhide-prepared-small-botanicalfiber\">Fiber Prepared Hide</a></strong>.",

  "game:botanicalleathers-corkpath-text": "<strong>IV. THE CORK PATH</strong>\n<i>The Tree's Armor.</i>\n\nOak offers a unique bark, cork, which once treated, becomes supple and waterproof. This is a complex method that demands patience and mastery of fire.\n\n<strong>1. Harvesting (Grid)</strong>\nStrip the bark from a fallen log. In the crafting grid, combine an <strong>Oak Log</strong> with an <strong>Axe</strong> and a <strong>Hammer</strong> to obtain <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:corkmaterial-raw\">Raw Oak Bark</a></strong> (and retrieve your debarked log).\n\n<strong>2. Softening (Barrel & Drying)</strong>\nRaw bark is brittle. Submerge it in a <strong>Barrel of Water</strong> (72h) to soften it. Once soaked, remove it and let it <strong>dry</strong> (24h) to obtain a stable prepared bark.\n\n<strong>3. Steaming (Fire)</strong>\nTo give the cork its final elasticity, it must be heated. Assemble <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:corkmaterial-prepared\">8 prepared barks</a></strong> into a <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:corkbundle-prepared\">Cork Bundle</a></strong>. Place this bundle in a <strong><a href=\"handbook://block-pitkiln\">pitkiln</a></strong> for steaming. Then, disassemble the steamed bundle.\n\n<strong>4. Rolling & Assembly</strong>\nStrike the steamed bark with a <strong>Hammer</strong> to flatten it into a <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:corkmaterial-sheet\">Cork Sheet</a></strong>.\nFinally, use a <strong>Knife</strong> and <strong>Resin</strong> (and Linen for the very large pieces) to assemble these sheets into a <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalhide-prepared-small-cork\">Prepared Cork Hide</a></strong>.",

FINAL TANNING</strong>\n<i>The Great Preservation.</i>\n\nWhether formed from fungus, fruit, or fiber, your <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-botanicalleathers:botanicalhide-prepared-small-cork\">Prepared Hide</a></strong> is still organic matter, prone to decay. It lacks the permanence of true leather.\n\n<strong>Observation on Mass</strong>\nAs you have likely discovered, the quantity of material used (Number of Paste Bowls or Mushroom Mash) determines the size of the resulting hide (Small, Medium, Large, Huge).\n\n<strong>1. Curing (Barrel)</strong>\nTo lock the fibers in place, the hide must be treated chemically. Seal it in a <strong>Barrel</strong> containing <strong>Limewater</strong> or <strong>Diluted Borax</strong>.\n\n<strong>2. The Transition</strong>\nAfter sealing, the botanical nature is masked. The item transforms into a standard <strong>Soaked Hide</strong>. From this point on, treat it exactly as you would an animal skin: Scrape it, and tan it (Oak/Acacia) to finish your work.",
